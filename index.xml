      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Madness in literature and film is a powerful and gripping theme at the center of many classic tragic stories. The psychology of anti-heroes moving towards their seemingly inevitable downfall raises deep questions over our minds&amp;rsquo; capacity for self-destruction. Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones very much follows this character arc in her transformation from a just and lovable Khaleesi into the Mad Queen. The burning of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing in Season 8 Episode 5 had all the ingredients to fulfil a descent into madness worthy of Shakespearian plays. While shocking, Dany&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; nevertheless failed to hit the mark and did not have the emotional impact an event 8 years in the making should have had. While fans have had many gripes with the hit series&amp;rsquo; last outing, there are small changes that could have been made to offer a more compelling and meaningful resolution for the Mother of Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prophecy-and-destiny&#34;&gt;Prophecy and Destiny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys&amp;rsquo; fate had been coming, if you were paying attention. The ruthlessness — and pyromaniac tendencies — she displayed against enemies throughout the show were only matched by her repeated desire to avoid the sins of her father. In her failed struggle against determinism, Daenerys&amp;rsquo; story follows a classic tragic archetype. Like Macbeth or Oedipus, she fought to avoid a path that had been set for her in prophecy. But like Anakin Skywalker, she could not escape her destiny and &amp;ldquo;became the very thing she sought to destroy&amp;rdquo;. All these characters share an internal chaos, which they translate into a lethal external one that ultimately leads to their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where GoT succeeded in planting the seeds for a destructive destiny, it is in building up her final inner turmoil that the show fell short. Despite her taste for fire and retribution, Daenerys has consitently portrayed as a stubbornly just ruler who is deeply sensitive to protecting the weak. The desire to turn the tables on the rulers and the ruled - &amp;ldquo;to break the wheel&amp;rdquo; - is at the core of a person. The burning of innocent townsfolk, including children, is a sudden and confounding deparature in character from the &amp;ldquo;Breaker of Chains&amp;rdquo;. Her state of loneliness and the deaths of her beloved Rhaegal and Missandei as they are shown are not enough to justify such a mistargeted and out of place reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ones-she-had-lost&#34;&gt;The Ones She Had Lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many have already pointed out, the latest season in the series has suffered from uneven pacing and could have benefited from having more than just 6 episodes to work with. Still, there are a few minor changes in the current plot that could have done the trick. I am no screenwriter but here&amp;rsquo;s what I propose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Albeit badly hurt while protecting Dany, Jorah Mormont survives the Battle of Winterfell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowed down by his injuries, he is captured alongside Missandei by Cersei.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are both brought to the &amp;ldquo;peace negotiations&amp;rdquo; with Daenerys&amp;rsquo; side, but importantly, the King&amp;rsquo;s Landing mob is present and revelling at the sight of these captured invaders. As it did during Ned Stark&amp;rsquo;s beheading, the crowd is delighted in anticipation of a public execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyrion&amp;rsquo;s speech is cut off by the Mountain obeying Cersei&amp;rsquo;s sudden command to decapitate Missandei. Dany&amp;rsquo;s silent shock is contrasted by the crowd&amp;rsquo;s raucous cheers. Daenerys moves forward to threaten Cersei, in her familiar tone, only to be replied with &amp;ldquo;Ser Gregor, now the other one&amp;rdquo;. While Dany can only look in horror, Jorah is calm and smiling at his Queen, as if to say that &amp;ldquo;everything will be OK&amp;rdquo;. He too dies under the applause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battle of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing can now unfold as it did in Episode 5. The moment where Daenerys loses control is already played brilliantly by Emilia Clarke but now takes an entirely new dimension. As Drogon is perched on the walls where Jorah spent his last moments, Daenerys relives that trauma with the city&amp;rsquo;s cries echoing in her head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/jorah.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jorah&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;madness-and-guilt&#34;&gt;Madness and Guilt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the capital&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants present during Missandei&amp;rsquo;s and Jorah&amp;rsquo;s executions is not only a no-brainer way to explain Dany&amp;rsquo;s resentment towards them, it would have also been pertinent to the larger themes of the show. Ever since Ned Stark&amp;rsquo;s death in the first season, King&amp;rsquo;s Landing has repeatedly been shown in a state of decadence with its people left to rot by ruling tyrants. As they do in ours, all civilisations reach their tipping point in the World of Ice and Fire (i.e. the Doom of Valyria). It would have been fitting for the series to come full circle and for the execution of another loyal Northman to be the final act that leads to the fall of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorah&amp;rsquo;s reimagined death under Cersei&amp;rsquo;s orders not only works as an impactful finishing blow for Dany&amp;rsquo;s mind, it also creates a cathartic conclusion to his otherwise unfulfilling journey. While sad, the end to his story as it was shown - i.e. killed by the undead in Winterfell - did not serve a real narrative purpose and seemed somewhat offbeat. Jorah is nothing if not the personification of unconditional love and support for Daenerys. He travelled continents, became a gladiator, and even came back from the dead (contracting greyscale) for her. A brutal and unjust death would only have been more deeply felt by Daenerys and the viewers because of the incredible lengths he has gone to be by his Queen&amp;rsquo;s side. There is no bigger &amp;ldquo;last straw&amp;rdquo; that could have pushed Dany&amp;rsquo;s mind over the cliffs of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show as it is seems satisfied to explain Dany&amp;rsquo;s actions based on a desire for vengeance. That is not enough. Other works of fiction have been much more convisincing in portraying madness by also incorporating the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s sense of responsibility towards their own hardship. I already mentioned Macbeth for example in which guilt is a key theme, slowly eating away at the main character. The same goes for King Lear whose madness is not only caused by the cruel actions of his daughters, but also from the remorse he feels over his own errors. Daenerys had her own King Lear moments. Just as Lear disowned his only truthful daughter Cordelia, Dany banished Jorah (twice!) long after his loyalty was no longer in question. Despite the rejections, he continued to prove his willingness to sacrifice himself for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany therefore had grounds to feel guilty that she not only could not protect Jorah in return, but also that she indirectly had a hand in his death. Instead, she tells Jon in Episode 4: &amp;ldquo;I couldn’t love him back, not the way he wanted, not the way I love you.&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like remorse to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of two films that better illustrate how it is also the guilt a character has over a loved one&amp;rsquo;s murder, and not just their loss, that helps justify their subsequent acts of madness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se7ven (1995) - David Fincher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpQzNEgQz5U&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dark Knight (2008) - Christopher Nolan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gGbAA_-IC4?controls=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones missed out on a great opportunity for the poignant final chapter it was after. Nevertheless, there may have been deciptively little to change to address most of the larger issues that relate to the conclusion to Daenerys Targaryen&amp;rsquo;s story. The ingredients were there but a closer look at the psychology of madness in previous works could have helped to better blend them together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Avoid the Tribal Trap of Stories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new piece of mine was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://areomagazine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Areo Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/strong&gt;, Yuval Noah Harari highlights the importance of stories (religious, national, etc&amp;hellip;) as the basis for human cooperation and of our modern societies. Stories are able to fill that role because of the way they shape how we think and provide shared morals. Cognitive research shows that we use analogy-based mental models to interpret and understand our reality. However we have seen that stories can also fuel tribalistic attitudes and dogmatism. Pointing out the parallels between mental and scientific models, this piece highlights the lessons we can learn from the scientific method in improving our reasoning and development of moral values.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catherine Deneuve, #MeToo, and the Fracturing Within Feminism</title>
      <link>/blogpost/deneuve/catherine-deneuve-me-too-and-the-fracturing-within-feminism/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blogpost/deneuve/catherine-deneuve-me-too-and-the-fracturing-within-feminism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to write an &lt;a href=&#34;http://quillette.com/2018/01/16/catherine-deneuve-metoo-fracturing-within-feminism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;opinion piece for &lt;strong&gt;Quillette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an online magazine on Science, Tech and Politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 100 women, including Catherine Deneuve, signed a letter warning over potential excesses of the MeToo movement, they faced a serious backlash. I argue that their nuanced view is valuable and is not only compatible with the fundamental message behind #MeToo, but can also help it lead to concrete change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the article on Quillette for more on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As an anecdote, my article was shared by one of the 5 original authors of the letter, Peggy Sastre. For all its faults, social media does provide an amazing reach for voices that would have no reason to be heard other than for the ideas they express.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[R] Plotting results from extRemes package - Extreme Value Analysis</title>
      <link>/post/r-plotting-results-from-extremes-package-extreme-value-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/Rextremes/returnlevel.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) in R you will have likely come across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extRemes/extRemes.pdf&#34;&gt;extRemes package, written by Eric Gilleland&lt;/a&gt;. While I am not (yet!) an expert in EVA, I have found this package to be quite accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package’s main function, &lt;strong&gt;‘fevd()’&lt;/strong&gt;, fits an extreme value distribution to data. Methods for plotting are available for objects of class ‘fevd’ to produce diagnostics and result plots, such as a return level plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is the restricted control you seem to have over the plot’s layout and general look. You can choose which plots to show, or to add a custom title, but not much else. What if you want to customise the plot to your liking, plot the results in another software/package or display two EVAs on the same figure as shown above?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not find an easy way to extract the information the package uses to generate the plots, nor could I find any mention of this problem online. In the off-chance someone is in the same situation, you’ll find a solution below. It seems a little awkward to me and if there is a better way that I am missing, please do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the data from the “extRemes” package, with the example for the Peaks Over Threshold approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(extRemes)
data(&amp;quot;damage&amp;quot;, package = &amp;quot;extRemes&amp;quot;)
fitD &amp;lt;- fevd(Dam, damage, threshold = 6, type = &amp;quot;GP&amp;quot;, time.units = &amp;quot;2.06/year&amp;quot;)
plot(fitD, type = &amp;quot;rl&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-04-15-r-plotting-results-from-extremes-package-extreme-value-analysis_files/figure-html/load%20data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to play with the original code for the package’s plot functions. When using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method, the function to change is &lt;strong&gt;‘plot.fevd.mle’&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are satisfied with the overall default aspect of the plots and just need to tweak it you can customise the code and reload the function. However, I generally use &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; to produce my figures and like to have a consistent template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your &lt;strong&gt;‘fevd’&lt;/strong&gt; object you will get the information you need to draw a Return Level plot with the following two functions (other types of plots and distributions will use a different section from &lt;strong&gt;plot.fevd.mle&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first returns a dataframe of return level point coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;getrlpoints &amp;lt;- function(fit){

xp2 &amp;lt;- ppoints(fit$n, a = 0)
ytmp &amp;lt;- datagrabber(fit)
y &amp;lt;- c(ytmp[, 1])
sdat &amp;lt;- sort(y)
npy &amp;lt;- fit$npy
u &amp;lt;- fit$threshold
rlpoints.x &amp;lt;- -1/log(xp2)[sdat &amp;gt; u]/npy
rlpoints.y &amp;lt;- sdat[sdat &amp;gt; u]
rlpoints &amp;lt;- data.frame(rlpoints.x, rlpoints.y)

return(rlpoints)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second returns a dataframe of estimated returned levels with confidence intervals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;getcidf &amp;lt;- function(fit){

rperiods = c(2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 120, 200, 250, 300, 500, 800)
bds &amp;lt;- ci(fit, return.period = rperiods)
c1 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,1])
c2 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,2])
c3 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,3])
ci_df &amp;lt;- data.frame(c1, c2, c3, rperiods) 

return(ci_df)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all you need to produce the plot in &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)

rlpoints &amp;lt;- getrlpoints(fitD)
ci_df &amp;lt;- getcidf(fitD)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = ci_df, aes(x = rperiods, y = c2), color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;) +
  geom_line(data = ci_df, aes(x = rperiods, y = c1), color = &amp;quot;grey&amp;quot;) +
  geom_line(data = ci_df, aes(x = rperiods, y = c3), color = &amp;quot;grey&amp;quot;) +
  geom_point(data = rlpoints, aes(x = rlpoints.x, y = rlpoints.y), size = 1) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Return Level (m)&amp;quot;) +
  xlab(&amp;quot;Return Period (Years)&amp;quot;) +
  scale_x_log10(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = c(2,5,10,20,50,100,200,500)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=12), axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-04-15-r-plotting-results-from-extremes-package-extreme-value-analysis_files/figure-html/plot%20returnlevels-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COP21: The Anchor to the Storm in Paris</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally written for the &lt;strong&gt;EnvEast Doctoral Training Partnership&lt;/strong&gt; student blog. EnvEast is a collaboration between three UK universities, including &lt;strong&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/strong&gt; where I am carrying out my PhD. The blog can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scienvy.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fluctuat-nec-mergitur&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fluctuat Nec Mergitur&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Battu par les flots, mais ne sombre pas. Tossed by the sea, but not sunk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centuries-old motto, which appears on the French capital&amp;rsquo;s crest, has been a central rallying cry in the wake of the Paris attacks. Public figures have reiterated its message in the last days, emphasising the need to resist and come together in the face of unimaginable adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paris and the international community have an opportunity to do just that in less than a fortnight. The &lt;strong&gt;COP21&lt;/strong&gt; has already been branded as the most important environmental conference of our lifetimes. Its significance is doubled now, as the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#COP21&lt;/a&gt; proceeds as planned. Even more so now. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#COP21&lt;/a&gt; = respecting our differences &amp;amp; same time acting together collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christiana Figueres (@CFigueres) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/665807301614284800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 15, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COP however is linked to this tragedy in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely 24 hours after the attacks, Bernie Sanders stated at the American Democratic presidential debate that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojFfyQFIINc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. While evidence is still lacking to fully support that claim, recent studies have looked at how climate impacts can exacerbate existing political instabilities &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(Kelley et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive result to climate change negotiations at the end of November would however also serve as a more direct response to terror. And this response is needed. As I am writing this post, France is still in national mourning and anxiety can very much be felt in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a French national and a PhD researcher in future flood risks, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but find meaning in both the literal and figurative sense of &amp;ldquo;Fluctuat nec mergitur&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; has become a key word in climate change science and adaptation policy. Yet it is worth noting the term has its roots in psychology and can be applied just as much at the societal level as to the individual. It represents the capacity to cope and bounce back from extreme events, the ability to weather the storm&amp;hellip;to be tossed by the sea, but not sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his already historic speech to the French Parliament on Monday, President Hollande reminded that the COP21 was to be a moment of &amp;ldquo;hope and solidarity&amp;rdquo;. It will also be a fight for collective knowledge and against obscurantism. Country representatives have an even greater responsibility now and perhaps after December 11th, anyone affected by terrorism can start to keep their heads above water.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The environmental paradox behind the Tianjin explosions</title>

&lt;p&gt;From water scarcity to air pollution, without forgetting world-leading greenhouse gas emissions, China is facing a multi-faceted environmental crisis. I was able to witness the extent of the issue first hand when I studied Environmental Management at Tsinghua University in Beijing as part of a joint program with the French university Mines ParisTech. The resounding blow of the August 12th explosions in Tianjin - which killed over a hundred people - has now pulled me back to that time spent in the &amp;ldquo;Middle Kingdom&amp;rdquo;. Amidst the apparent lack of available information about the disaster and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/17/tianjin-explosions-fears-over-pollution-as-chinese-media-lambasts-officials&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fears of cyanide pollution&lt;/a&gt;, a memory that stands out is my field trip to Tianjin in 2013, which highlights a revealing paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tianjin/explosion.png&#34; alt=&#34;cars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visit consisted in two stops: the &lt;strong&gt;Sino-Singaporean Tianjin Eco-city&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Tianjin Economic -Technological Development Area&lt;/strong&gt; (TEDA). These are exciting places to be in for anyone interested in the environment. My classmates and I were indeed amazed by the level of commitment shown for concepts ranging from sustainable cities to industrial ecology and circular economy. We had set foot on the flagship projects of a country aggressively promoting innovative solutions to serious environmental issues. Jump forward two years, they are now within walking distance (that&amp;rsquo;s really close in China) from the remains of a devastating industrial explosion and potentially deadly chemical leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tianjin/teda.png&#34; alt=&#34;teda&#34; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Large model of the Tianjin Economic Technological Development Area (TEDA) presented to my class in 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;before-the-explosions-tianjin-s-giant-leaps-towards-sustainable-development&#34;&gt;Before the explosions: Tianjin&amp;rsquo;s giant leaps towards sustainable development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a drastic contrast between the image of Tianjin that we have been getting this week and the one I brought back from my visit. It is difficult to imagine from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfXmG3GdAig&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shocking videos&lt;/a&gt; of the blast that less than 10 kms away are areas that strive for an exemplary socio-economic and environmental performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tianjinecocity.gov.sg/bg_intro.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tianjin Eco-city&lt;/a&gt; for instance looks to build &amp;ldquo;a thriving city which is socially harmonious, environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient&amp;rdquo;. Started in 2007, the 30 km2 neighbourhood&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to abide by careful planning rules through the integrated management of water, waste, green areas, transport and land use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eco-city itself is set within the boundaries of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecoteda.org/english/show.php?itemid=4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TEDA&lt;/a&gt; (泰达, literally: &amp;ldquo;peace&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo; prosperity&amp;rdquo;), a zone created in 1984 as one of the first industrial clusters in China. The area, which hosts international companies from a wide range of sectors, has since 2000 carried out a transformation to an &lt;strong&gt;Eco-Industrial Park&lt;/strong&gt; (EIP). Taking advantage of the proximity and diversity of a large number of industries, an EIP promotes the sharing of resources, by-products and services to increase the efficiency of the area as a whole. In TEDA, these growing synergies have notably allowed for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/6/9/6325/pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;significant CO2 emissions reductions and to avoid large quantities of waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both projects represent a genuine dedication to sustainable development that many western countries could learn from. And yet since August 12th, I don&amp;rsquo;t think &amp;ldquo;harmony&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prosperity&amp;rdquo; are the words on everyone&amp;rsquo;s lips in Tianjin. The contradiction brings forward a deep-rooted problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-two-speed-race-against-the-environmental-crisis&#34;&gt;A two-speed race against the environmental crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s environmental struggle is a pressing issue. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://berkeleyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/China-Air-Quality-Paper-July-2015.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a study from Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; recently reiterated for example, deteriorating air quality is having a considerable impact on human health in highly populated regions of the country. Children in Beijing will even tell you what PM2.5 is (dangerous particulate matter) !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has increasingly made it clear in recent years that environmental protection was at the top of its agenda. In 2014, General Secretary &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2014/apr/25/china-environment-law-fines-for-pollution&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Xi Jinping &amp;ldquo;declared war&amp;rdquo; on pollution&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it was &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rsquo;s red-light warning against the model of inefficient and blind development&amp;rdquo;. Alongside harsher laws against polluters, the government has also made large investments to support sustainable projects, such as TEDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tianjin/view.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;view&#34; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from my dorm at Tsinghua University on a pollution day qualified as &amp;ldquo;extremely unhealthy&amp;rdquo; (2013-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of all these efforts, the Tianjin explosions &lt;strong&gt;raise many questions&lt;/strong&gt;. How could such a disaster occur in one of the most important ports in the world? While the actual reasons remain unknown, the state of China&amp;rsquo;s Environmental and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is telling. Although reporting has been on the rise, the general lack of consequences and control has allowed most firms to ignore their own official sustainability expectations. The unfair treatment of workers, the disregard for regulations and standards as well as cases of pollution of water, air and soils by factories are hence &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cracks-down-on-water-polluting-industries-1429267822&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;still widespread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The aftermath of the accident&lt;/strong&gt; is just as puzzling. A week has passed and it is still unclear whether there remains a threat to the environment and Tianjin&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Distrust of governmental reports and a general lack of information have pushed some people living around the blast to leave the city as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/world/asia/china-identifies-executives-of-company-linked-to-tianjin-explosions.html?_r=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York Times showed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who has been to China has experienced censorship in some shape or form, even if it is as simple as a blocked access to Facebook (the horror&amp;hellip;). Here lies another contradiction. Transparency is indeed a key principle behind CSR. It is therefore difficult for the government to expect private companies to respect sustainable performance goals as long as the censor-culture still exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the whole story is more complex, the symbolic proximity of forward-looking projects to such alarming devastation only further fuels the notion that there are still two Chinas when it comes to sustainability. The country has the resources, capacity and knowledge to work towards its environmental goals, but still needs to &lt;strong&gt;translate its ambitions&lt;/strong&gt; within society and notably with certain members of the industrial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delving into Dreams</title>
      <link>/blogpost/dreams/delving-into-dreams/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2010, like many others I was captivated by the mind-bending storyline and visuals of Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Inception&lt;/strong&gt;. Following Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb on his struggle to get back to his children, the film introduced the unique concept of navigating through dreams - and dreams within dreams. At the time I saw the movie, I was staying at a rented holiday house in Falmouth, Massachusetts on the southern tip of Cape Cod. It was the appropriate New England setting for me to stumble upon Dennis Lehane&amp;rsquo;s novel, Shutter Island, as I was shuffling through a stranger&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf. &lt;strong&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/strong&gt; had just been adapted to the big screen by Martin Scorsese a couple months before Inception and also starred DiCaprio, this time as Teddy Daniels, a U.S. marshal investigating a missing patient case at a hospital for the criminally insane off the coast of Boston Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two films with drastically different tones and plots, and yet deeply rooted similarities - beyond just the Leo-connection! - which didn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind until I opened Lehane&amp;rsquo;s book. The first thing I saw was the epigraph. A short and deceptively trivial extract from &lt;strong&gt;Questions of Travel&lt;/strong&gt;, by Elizabeth Bishop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; must we dream our dreams
and have them, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spinning-tabletop&#34;&gt;The Spinning Tabletop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her poem, Bishop ponders on the need to travel if one can rely on his or her own mind and imagination. How can that apply to a cop trapped on a gloomy island? The movie version of Shutter Island is faithful to the book in the way it uses the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s dreams - or rather, nightmares - as a periscope into his subconscious to set up clues for a final shocking twist. We learn that Teddy Daniels is not a cop, but a patient of the mental institution, living out his own fantasy. The reveal is rendered even more effective as we follow the story from Teddy&amp;rsquo;s perspective and are drawn into his paranoia. We are on his side. We ask ourselves until the very end: Is he sane or mad? What was in his head and what actually happened? What was real and what was a dream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These very same questions and another enigmatic ending are what made Inception a cultural phenomenon. The famous last shot of a spinning tabletop - the embodiment of DiCaprio&amp;rsquo;s character&amp;rsquo;s grasp on reality - left audiences without a definite answer. Countless internet theories argued whether he had in fact been reunited with his family or if this was just one of the many dreams of his children we see over the course of the movie. In that sense, both stories draw upon the Freudian interpretation of dreams as &amp;ldquo;wish fulfilment&amp;rdquo;. The characters see what they want to see as their own unconscious way to resolve a past emotional clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inception is highly reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe&amp;rsquo;s poem from 1849, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/237388&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;A Dream Within a Dream&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which also deals with the ambiguity of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an interview where Christopher Nolan cites the poem as an inspiration, it ties into the comparison between Inception and Shutter in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trauma-of-loss&#34;&gt;Trauma of Loss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/trauma.png&#34; alt=&#34;trauma&#34; /&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cobb and Mal (Inception) - Teddy and Dolores (Shutter Island)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the word &amp;lsquo;trauma&amp;rsquo; comes from the Greek for &amp;lsquo;wound&amp;rsquo;? And what is the German word for &amp;lsquo;dream&amp;rsquo;? Traum. Ein Traum. Wounds can create monsters, and you, you are wounded, Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This powerful quote from the movie Shutter Island - which is not in the book - speaks volumes about Teddy&amp;rsquo;s mindset and could also easily apply to Cobb in Inception. Their trauma, wounds and dreams share a common tragic origin. Just as Edgar Allan Poe in &amp;lsquo;A Dream Within a Dream&amp;rsquo; begins by stating &amp;ldquo;Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now&amp;rdquo;, the catalyst for the lead&amp;rsquo;s inner conflict in both films is the loss of his wife. The wives of Shutter Island and Inception are not exactly &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; partners. Their fatal actions leave in their wake much grief and pain, living up to their names: Dolores and Mal respectively (from Latin, meaning sorrow and evil). Both fall into manic depressions, losing track of reality. Dolores drowns her children before asking her husband to kill her. Mal commits suicide after threatening to take her son and daughter with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They continue to appear in their husbands&amp;rsquo; dreams not only as loving memories but also as mysterious antagonistic figures. We moreover learn that both Cobb and Teddy had their share of responsibility in their wives&amp;rsquo; fate, adding to their distress and justifying the sense of guilt expressed in their nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lost-at-sea&#34;&gt;Lost at Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/inception.png&#34; alt=&#34;inception&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point I wanted to mention relates to the opening sequence in Inception, as pictured above. The first images are prolonged shots of waves crashing against the shore in slow motion. Finally, we see DiCaprio, lying barely conscious on the beach, reaching out - in vain - for what seems to be his children making a sand castle in the distance. Hallucination? A dream within a dream. This shore, clawing away at crumbling buildings, is but an imaginary state of &amp;ldquo;limbo&amp;rdquo; where the mind loses itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an unavoidable resemblance between this scene and Poe&amp;rsquo;s poem. He indeed laments about a &amp;ldquo;pitiless wave&amp;rdquo; on a &amp;ldquo;a surf-tormented shore&amp;rdquo; and speaks of holding to &amp;ldquo;grains of golden sand&amp;rdquo; throughout &amp;lsquo;A Dream Within a Dream&amp;rsquo; to symbolize death and time passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waves and the sea are ever-present threats on Shutter Island, particularly through the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s eyes. We are constantly reminded that swimming off towards the mainland would in all certainty be fatal. Water is also there in Teddy&amp;rsquo;s dreams as a dangerous entity. In the book, the sentence &amp;ldquo;why are you all wet?&amp;rdquo; is repeated without clear meaning. It is only at the end that the reader is told this was the last thing he said to his wife, before realizing she had gone out to drown their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found these many connections, while not obvious at first glance, to be difficult to &amp;ldquo;unsee&amp;rdquo; and speak for the unique qualities of dreams as storytelling tools. They purposefully disorientate as much as subtly divulge information on the characters. It is not surprising for Edgar Allan Poe, Dennis Lehane and Christopher Nolan - adepts of the strange and mysterious - to have this common interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see any other similarities between the movies, or with any other work? Let me know in a comment!&lt;/p&gt;
