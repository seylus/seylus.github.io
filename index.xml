&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/Chernobyl_Thyroid.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBO’s latest mini-series &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; is both haunting and gripping in retelling the events that followed the night of April 26th 1986. The show is not only a fascinating window into the Soviet world that once was, it also serves as a contemporary reminder of “what is the cost of lies”, to quote the final episode’s ultimate line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant’s reactor 4 was an environmental and human disaster that impacted countless lives across Europe. Children in neighbouring countries at the time of the incident were particularly affected by the emitted radiation, with rates of cancer increasing in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above animated map shows the incidence of thyroid cancer in Belarus from 1981 to 2002. It was created in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;tmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sf&lt;/code&gt; packages, with data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.22037&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cardis et al. (2006)&lt;/a&gt;. The code to create the animation is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daenerys&#39; Descent into Madness</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Madness in literature and film is a powerful and gripping theme at the center of many classic tragic stories. The psychology of anti-heroes moving towards their seemingly inevitable downfall raises deep questions over our minds&amp;rsquo; capacity for self-destruction. Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones very much follows this character arc in her transformation from a just and lovable Khaleesi into the Mad Queen. The burning of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing in Season 8 Episode 5 had all the ingredients to fulfil a descent into madness worthy of Shakespearian plays. While shocking, Dany&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; nevertheless failed to hit the mark and did not have the emotional impact an event 8 years in the making should have had. While fans have had many gripes with the hit series&amp;rsquo; last outing, there are small changes that could have been made to offer a more compelling and meaningful resolution for the Mother of Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prophecy-and-destiny&#34;&gt;Prophecy and Destiny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daenerys&amp;rsquo; fate had been coming, if you were paying attention. The ruthlessness — and pyromaniac tendencies — she displayed against enemies throughout the show were only matched by her repeated desire to avoid the sins of her father. In her failed struggle against determinism, Daenerys&amp;rsquo; story follows a classic tragic archetype. Like Macbeth or Oedipus, she fought to avoid a path that had been set for her in prophecy. But like Anakin Skywalker, she could not escape her destiny and &amp;ldquo;became the very thing she sought to destroy&amp;rdquo;. All these characters share an internal chaos, which they translated into a lethal external one that ultimately led to their demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where GoT succeeded in planting the seeds for a destructive destiny, it is in building up Daenarys&amp;rsquo; final inner turmoil that the show fell short. Despite her taste for fire and retribution, Dany was consistently portrayed as a stubbornly just ruler who was deeply sensitive to protecting the weak. The desire to turn the tables on the rulers and the ruled - &amp;ldquo;to break the wheel&amp;rdquo; - is at the core of her person. The burning of innocent townsfolk, including children, was therefore a sudden and confounding departure in character from the &amp;ldquo;Breaker of Chains&amp;rdquo;. Her state of loneliness and the deaths of her beloved Rhaegal and Missandei as they are shown are not enough to justify such a mistargeted and out of place reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ones-she-had-lost&#34;&gt;The Ones She Had Lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many have already pointed out, the latest season in the series has suffered from uneven pacing and could have benefited from having more than just 6 episodes to work with. Still, there are a few minor changes in the current plot that could have done the trick. I am no screenwriter but here&amp;rsquo;s what I propose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Albeit badly hurt while protecting Dany, Jorah Mormont survives the Battle of Winterfell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowed down by his injuries, he is captured alongside Missandei by Cersei.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are both brought to the &amp;ldquo;peace negotiations&amp;rdquo; with Daenerys&amp;rsquo; side, but importantly, the King&amp;rsquo;s Landing mob is present and revelling at the sight of these captured invaders. As it did during Ned Stark&amp;rsquo;s beheading, the crowd is delighted in anticipation of a public execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyrion&amp;rsquo;s speech is cut off by the Mountain obeying Cersei&amp;rsquo;s sudden command to decapitate Missandei. Dany&amp;rsquo;s silent shock is contrasted by the crowd&amp;rsquo;s raucous cheers. Daenerys moves forward to threaten Cersei, in her familiar tone, only to be replied with &amp;ldquo;Ser Gregor, now the other one&amp;rdquo;. While Dany can only look in horror, Jorah is calm and smiling at his Queen, as if to say that &amp;ldquo;everything will be OK&amp;rdquo;. He too dies under the applause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battle of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing can now unfold as it did in Episode 5. The moment where Daenerys loses control is already played brilliantly by Emilia Clarke but now takes an entirely new dimension. As Drogon is perched on the walls where Jorah spent his last moments, Daenerys relives that trauma with the city&amp;rsquo;s cries echoing in her head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/jorah.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jorah&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;madness-and-guilt&#34;&gt;Madness and Guilt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the capital&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants present during Missandei&amp;rsquo;s and Jorah&amp;rsquo;s executions is not only a no-brainer way to explain Dany&amp;rsquo;s resentment towards them, it would have also been pertinent to the larger themes of the show. Ever since Ned Stark&amp;rsquo;s death in the first season, King&amp;rsquo;s Landing has repeatedly been shown in a state of decadence with its people left to rot by ruling tyrants. As they do in ours, all civilisations reach their tipping point in the World of Ice and Fire (i.e. the Doom of Valyria). It would have been fitting for the series to come full circle and for the execution of another loyal Northman to be the final act that leads to the fall of King&amp;rsquo;s Landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorah&amp;rsquo;s reimagined death under Cersei&amp;rsquo;s orders not only works as an impactful finishing blow for Dany&amp;rsquo;s mind, it also creates a cathartic conclusion to his otherwise unfulfilling journey. While sad, the end to his story as it was shown - i.e. killed by the undead in Winterfell - did not serve a real narrative purpose and seemed somewhat offbeat. Jorah is nothing if not the personification of unconditional love and support for Daenerys. He travelled continents, became a gladiator, and even came back from the dead (contracting greyscale) for her. A brutal and unjust death would only have been more deeply felt by Daenerys and the viewers because of the incredible lengths he has gone to be by his Queen&amp;rsquo;s side. There is no bigger &amp;ldquo;last straw&amp;rdquo; that could have pushed Dany&amp;rsquo;s mind over the cliffs of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show as it is seems satisfied to explain Dany&amp;rsquo;s actions based on a desire for vengeance. That is not enough. Other works of fiction have been much more convincing in portraying madness by also incorporating the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s sense of responsibility towards their own hardship. I already mentioned Macbeth for example in which guilt is a key theme, slowly eating away at the main character. The same goes for King Lear whose madness is not only caused by the cruel actions of his daughters, but also from the remorse he feels over his own errors. Daenerys had her own King Lear moments. Just as Lear disowned his only honest daughter Cordelia, Dany banished Jorah (twice!) long after his loyalty was no longer in question. Despite the rejections, he continued to prove his willingness to sacrifice himself for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dany therefore had grounds to feel guilty that she not only could not protect Jorah in return, but also that she indirectly had a hand in his death. Instead, she tells Jon in Episode 4: &amp;ldquo;I couldn’t love him back, not the way he wanted, not the way I love you.&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like remorse to me. I can think of two films that better illustrate how it is also the guilt a character feels over a loved one&amp;rsquo;s murder, and not just their loss, that helps justify their subsequent acts of madness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se7en (1995) - David Fincher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpQzNEgQz5U&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dark Knight (2008) - Christopher Nolan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gGbAA_-IC4?controls=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones missed out on a great opportunity for the poignant final chapter it was after. Nevertheless, there may have been deciptively little to change to address most of the larger issues in the conclusion to Daenerys Targaryen&amp;rsquo;s story. The ingredients were there but a closer look at the psychology of madness in previous works could have helped to better blend them together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Avoid the Tribal Trap of Stories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new piece of mine was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://areomagazine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Areo Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/strong&gt;, Yuval Noah Harari highlights the importance of stories (religious, national, etc&amp;hellip;) as the basis for human cooperation and of our modern societies. Stories are able to fill that role because of the way they shape how we think and provide shared morals. Cognitive research shows that we use analogy-based mental models to interpret and understand our reality. However we have seen that stories can also fuel tribalistic attitudes and dogmatism. Pointing out the parallels between mental and scientific models, this piece highlights the lessons we can learn from the scientific method in improving our reasoning and development of moral values.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catherine Deneuve, #MeToo, and the Fracturing Within Feminism</title>
      <link>/blogpost/deneuve/catherine-deneuve-me-too-and-the-fracturing-within-feminism/</link>

      <guid>/blogpost/deneuve/catherine-deneuve-me-too-and-the-fracturing-within-feminism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to write an &lt;a href=&#34;http://quillette.com/2018/01/16/catherine-deneuve-metoo-fracturing-within-feminism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;opinion piece for &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an online magazine on Science, Tech and Politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 100 women, including Catherine Deneuve, signed a letter warning over potential excesses of the MeToo movement, they faced a serious backlash. I argue that their nuanced view is valuable and is not only compatible with the fundamental message behind #MeToo, but can also help it lead to concrete change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the article on Quillette for more on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As an anecdote, my article was shared by one of the 5 original authors of the letter, Peggy Sastre. For all its faults, social media does provide an amazing reach for voices that would have no reason to be heard other than for the ideas they express.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[R] Plotting results from extRemes package - Extreme Value Analysis</title>
      <link>/post/r-plotting-results-from-extremes-packages-extreme-value-analysis/extremes-return-level-plot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/r-plotting-results-from-extremes-packages-extreme-value-analysis/extremes-return-level-plot/</guid>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/Rextremes/returnlevel.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) in R you will have likely come across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extRemes/extRemes.pdf&#34;&gt;extRemes package, written by Eric Gilleland&lt;/a&gt;. While I am not (yet!) an expert in EVA, I have found this package to be quite accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package’s main function, &lt;strong&gt;‘fevd()’&lt;/strong&gt;, fits an extreme value distribution to data. Methods for plotting are available for objects of class ‘fevd’ to produce diagnostics and result plots, such as a return level plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is the restricted control you seem to have over the plot’s layout and general look. You can choose which plots to show, or to add a custom title, but not much else. What if you want to customise the plot to your liking, plot the results in another software/package or display two EVAs on the same figure as shown above?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not find an easy way to extract the information the package uses to generate the plots, nor could I find any mention of this problem online. In the off-chance someone is in the same situation, you’ll find a solution below. It seems a little awkward to me and if there is a better way that I am missing, please do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the data from the “extRemes” package, with the example for the Peaks Over Threshold approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(extRemes)
data(&amp;quot;damage&amp;quot;, package = &amp;quot;extRemes&amp;quot;)
fitD &amp;lt;- fevd(Dam, damage, threshold = 6, type = &amp;quot;GP&amp;quot;, time.units = &amp;quot;2.06/year&amp;quot;)
plot(fitD, type = &amp;quot;rl&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/r-plotting-results-from-extremes-packages-extreme-value-analysis/index_files/figure-html/load%20data-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to play with the original code for the package’s plot functions. When using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method, the function to change is &lt;strong&gt;‘plot.fevd.mle’&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are satisfied with the overall default aspect of the plots and just need to tweak it you can customise the code and reload the function. However, I generally use &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt; to produce my figures and like to have a consistent template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your &lt;strong&gt;‘fevd’&lt;/strong&gt; object you will get the information you need to draw a Return Level plot with the following two functions (other types of plots and distributions will use a different section from &lt;strong&gt;plot.fevd.mle&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first returns a dataframe of return level point coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;getrlpoints &amp;lt;- function(fit){

xp2 &amp;lt;- ppoints(fit$n, a = 0)
ytmp &amp;lt;- datagrabber(fit)
y &amp;lt;- c(ytmp[, 1])
sdat &amp;lt;- sort(y)
npy &amp;lt;- fit$npy
u &amp;lt;- fit$threshold
rlpoints.x &amp;lt;- -1/log(xp2)[sdat &amp;gt; u]/npy
rlpoints.y &amp;lt;- sdat[sdat &amp;gt; u]
rlpoints &amp;lt;- data.frame(rlpoints.x, rlpoints.y)

return(rlpoints)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second returns a dataframe of estimated returned levels with confidence intervals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;getcidf &amp;lt;- function(fit){

rperiods = c(2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 120, 200, 250, 300, 500, 800)
bds &amp;lt;- ci(fit, return.period = rperiods)
c1 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,1])
c2 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,2])
c3 &amp;lt;- as.numeric(bds[,3])
ci_df &amp;lt;- data.frame(c1, c2, c3, rperiods) 

return(ci_df)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all you need to produce the plot in &lt;strong&gt;ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Registered S3 methods overwritten by &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;:
##   method         from 
##   [.quosures     rlang

      <title>COP21: The Anchor to the Storm in Paris</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally written for the &lt;strong&gt;EnvEast Doctoral Training Partnership&lt;/strong&gt; student blog. EnvEast is a collaboration between three UK universities, including &lt;strong&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/strong&gt; where I am carrying out my PhD. The blog can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scienvy.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fluctuat-nec-mergitur&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fluctuat Nec Mergitur&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Battu par les flots, mais ne sombre pas. Tossed by the sea, but not sunk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centuries-old motto, which appears on the French capital&amp;rsquo;s crest, has been a central rallying cry in the wake of the Paris attacks. Public figures have reiterated its message in the last days, emphasising the need to resist and come together in the face of unimaginable adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paris and the international community have an opportunity to do just that in less than a fortnight. The &lt;strong&gt;COP21&lt;/strong&gt; has already been branded as the most important environmental conference of our lifetimes. Its significance is doubled now, as the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#COP21&lt;/a&gt; proceeds as planned. Even more so now. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#COP21&lt;/a&gt; = respecting our differences &amp;amp; same time acting together collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christiana Figueres (@CFigueres) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/665807301614284800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 15, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COP however is linked to this tragedy in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely 24 hours after the attacks, Bernie Sanders stated at the American Democratic presidential debate that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojFfyQFIINc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. While evidence is still lacking to fully support that claim, recent studies have looked at how climate impacts can exacerbate existing political instabilities &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(Kelley et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive result to climate change negotiations at the end of November would however also serve as a more direct response to terror. And this response is needed. As I am writing this post, France is still in national mourning and anxiety can very much be felt in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a French national and a PhD researcher in future flood risks, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but find meaning in both the literal and figurative sense of &amp;ldquo;Fluctuat nec mergitur&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; has become a key word in climate change science and adaptation policy. Yet it is worth noting the term has its roots in psychology and can be applied just as much at the societal level as to the individual. It represents the capacity to cope and bounce back from extreme events, the ability to weather the storm&amp;hellip;to be tossed by the sea, but not sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his already historic speech to the French Parliament on Monday, President Hollande reminded that the COP21 was to be a moment of &amp;ldquo;hope and solidarity&amp;rdquo;. It will also be a fight for collective knowledge and against obscurantism. Country representatives have an even greater responsibility now and perhaps after December 11th, anyone affected by terrorism can start to keep their heads above water.&lt;/p&gt;
