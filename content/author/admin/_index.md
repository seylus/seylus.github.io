I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of East Anglia](https://people.uea.ac.uk/u_pasquier) in Norwich, UK, working within the [Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research](https://tyndall.ac.uk/people/ulysse-pasquier). I study **future flooding risk and the adaptation process to the impacts of climate change in coastal areas**. My project is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC, EnvEast) in partnership with the [Broads Authority](https://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/).
